To do list for UI:

- rename tabs:
    - arrow pad => manual control
    - flash LED => test + enable CV, disable CV
    - control values => PID values
    - create "autonomous" tab with follow me button, assign key location button (lets you write it down), return home button
    - reorganise autonomous tab to have follow me on the left side, assign key location and return to key location on the right side
    - have a show key location button which has a table displaying all key locations, and by clicking on these, we set that location as key location
 
- set one mode button per relevant tab:
    - set manual
    - set autonomous
    - set test mode
 
  
   
  The goal for UI is to send command strings to backend
