# Tests delevelopment

The tests are used to incrementally understand how to implment features such as communication, computer vision, UI...

The tests will be deloped in the following order:

  **1. SSH test:** Program the PI remotely

  **2. Camera test:** Test if the camera can be opened in openCV

  **3. Communication Test:** test communication from the Ui to the Pi to the ESP32
  
  **4. Camera test:** Computer vision test: Test that the robot can be controlled remotely to react to computer vision inputs
